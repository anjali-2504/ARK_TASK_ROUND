# There is a folder named Q_learning_Tic-Tac-Toe which has 3 files in it. 
''' This is just the 2D tic-tac-toe game with GUI and has not used openAI gym environment and makes use of the Q_learning algorithm. '''
''' Also,the Q_player has already been trained and the training values for each episode has been written down in a separate file called Q_epsilon_09_Nepisodes_200000.p  file'''
''' So you just need to play the tic-tac-toe by running Tic_Tac_Toe_Human_vs_QPlayer.py file '''


Q_Learning_Tic_Tac_Toe.py
Tic_Tac_Toe_Human_vs_QPlayer.py
Tic_Tac_Toe_QPlayer_training.py- This is for training the Q_player

# There is a folder named gym-tictactoe3d which has a folder named gym_tictactoe-3d in it. 
''' This folder has the required environment needed for playing the game.'''
''' For installation of open AI gym:
    
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
pip install -e .
'''
''' This is the 3-D version of the game. Though it needed more than 2 crore episodes to train the player ,So it might not be too perfect in winning the game. '''
''' The file Q_value.txt stores the dictionary having corresponding values for a particular move '''
''' You just need to run example.py to play the game. '''
'''The game uses terminal to display the tic-tac-toe-board inspite of GUI.'''

# There is a folder named gym-tictactoe3d which has a folder named gym_tictactoe in it. 
''' This folder has the required environment needed for playing the game.'''
''' For installation of open AI gym:
    
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
pip install -e .
'''
''' This is the 2-D version of the game and mainly makes use of the minimax-algorithm. The game uses terminal to display the tic-tac-toe-board inspite of GUI.'''
''' There is a example folder in it which has many files for various types of players.'''
''' I have worked with the human_agent.py file '''

# There is a folder named gym-tictactoe3d which has a folder named Q_learn_github2 in it. 
''' This folder does not use any openAI gym environment for playing but is a similar version of gym_tictactoe-3d folder'''. 
''' I was experimenting with the both the gym as well as non-gym environment '''
''' The function here would not return the rewards and other info here. Rest the logic is quite similar '''
